# Overview

Electrical training is designed to introduce all of the main tasks of electrical and give an overview of each one. Basic coding experience is assumed, but not neccessary. Otherwise, all you need is a computer and internet connection. If you already have any amount of experience with circuits or board design, some of the labs may be too slow. Feel free to go ahead, or ask for a harder project to do for the week. 

These labs will guide you through designing a circuit board to power some LEDs that happen to fit nicely into the center of the CalSol logo. With the basis, you should be able to get started with any project in electrical, and although this isn't anywhere near enough to be able to complete something, it should establish a baseline high enough to what questions to ask and all of the basic concepts. 

## Week 1: Intro and Setup
The goal of this week is to get set up for embedded programming next week. That includes intros to the main tools that we use as a team: Slack, Git, KiCAD, and the software in our build process. 

## Week 2: BRAIN train part 1
Introduction to embedded programming and firmware. I wish we could teach you how to program a car, but sadly we don't have the time to do that. You'll learn how to make some lights blink though.

## Week 3: Soldering
Find your way of doing surface-mount soldering. Soldering boards involves being comfortable with tweezers in one hand and a soldering iron in the other, and even if you've never soldered anything before you'll have a nice LED board completed by the end of this week. Then we'll write some code to have amazing blinky lights.

## Week 4: Circuits
Resistors, capacitors, diodes, ICs, crystals, all the commonly used components for the boards on our cars. We'll talk the basics of what each does and the math of why we use them.

## Week 5: KiCAD schematic
Start learning how to use our favorite circuit board design software, KiCAD. Get all of the circuit components into your schematic in an organized, reviewable way with the standard CalSol settings.

## Week 6: KiCAD layout
Become a true hardware person and work with those circuit lines that you see everywhere. Introduce yourself to KiCAD's layout tool and arrange that schematic onto a board that you one day might be able to hold.

## Week 7: Up to you
Pick a topic or ongoing project, and learn as much as you can about it. Find the person currently working on that project, or find someone that knows a lot about that subject. Ask them questions, google what you don't understand, and figure out what you're interested in working on :)
