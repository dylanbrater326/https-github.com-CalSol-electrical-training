# Overview

Electrical training is designed to introduce all of the main tasks of electrical and give an overview of each one. Basic coding experience is assumed, but not neccessary. Otherwise, all you need is a computer and internet connection. If you already have any amount of experience with circuits or board design, some of the labs may be too slow. Feel free to go ahead, or ask for a harder project to do for the week. 

These labs will guide you through designing a circuit board to power some LEDs that happen to fit nicely into the center of the CalSol logo. With the basis, you should be able to get started with any project in electrical, and although this isn't anywhere near enough to be able to complete something, it should establish a baseline high enough to what questions to ask and all of the basic concepts. 

## Week 1: Intro and Setup
The goal of this week is to get set up for embedded programming next week. That includes intros to the main tools that we use as a team: Slack, Git, KiCAD, and the software in our build process.
