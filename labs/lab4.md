# CalSol Electrical Workshop
## Lab 4: Circuits
* learn basic circuit componets and how they work together
* start learning about the board that you will create

## Introduction
Everyone in EECS is essentially CS. Our goal for now is to make you a little more EE. The goal of the rest of the labs is for you to design your own little circuit board that will have an encoder, some LEDs, and a microcontroller. These will cover the basics of what the design, schematic, and layout process in CalSol involves, so after this hopefully you feel a little more ready to work on a car-ready board.

The focus for this lab is smaller scale, the individual components and how they work in a circuit.

### Notes
- Don't worry if you have no or very little experience with circuits. These labs are written assuming a bit of prior experience, but they're doable if you're coming in without much.
- If you have a lot of prior experience with circuits, the next couple labs are going to be really really easy. Breeze through them if you want, but also talk to a returning member about some other project to do too.

## THE LESSON
There are a few essential components of the board that you need to know
- resistors
- capacitors
- diodes
- batteries
- encoder
- microcontroller
Check the presentation for descriptions about what each part does, as here we'll focus on how they work together in this board.
