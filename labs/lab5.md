# CalSol Electrical Workshop
## Lab 5: Introduction to Circuits
* Learn how components interact in small circuit
* See how different circuits are used to create a functional board

## Introduction
This lab is probably going to be a long one. It's going to be a crash course in EE, be sure to check out the lecture slides for quick explanations of different parts. Otherwise, buckle up and be ready to learn hardware!!

## THE LESSON
The next couple labs have the overall goal of you designing and building a circuit for a board that will have a battery, encoder, microcontroller, and some LEDs that you can blink. This week we're going over the full circuit on paper, walking you through the different parts and what each does.

### Components in Circuits

#### Resistors in Parallel and Series
wow math v=ir current voltage total resistance inverse something, question about effective resistance

#### Capacitors in Parallel and Series
p much the same thing but capacitors and why, question about overall capacitance

#### Sensors
count rotations ticks per revolution read from microcontroller and things change wow, question about how to do the math

### What They Do

#### Voltage Dividers
resistors current voltage led something current draw led rated to whatever so need some resistor to make blink, have some math about resistor values

#### RC Filters
capacitors resistors noise cutoff frequency make signals nice something, have some easy math about setting cutoff and highpass/lowpass 

#### something else? i couldnt really tell

### The Full Circuit
start with the micro, say what you need to get a certain part to work and why, then make it a question about how to do that. goal is they draw things out on paper so i'll get pics of the components in kicad that we can add to the lab so they aren't completely clueless.

## Conclusion
Next week, you'll be learning how to create this same circuit in the PCB design software we use, KiCAD.
