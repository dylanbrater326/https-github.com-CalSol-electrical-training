## Lab 3: Soldering
* practice soldering surface-mount components

## Introduction
Soldering what we do to attach those tiny resistors, chips, and more to a circuit board: melt a bit of metal onto the area that holds the parts together when it cools and solidifies. It's manual labor, but it's much better than sanding molds. Once you get more used to it, it's pretty relaxing. Soon, you will get to that point.

## THE LESSON
This is definitely a learn by doing lab. Because we don't have very many places in Supernode you can solder, be sure to sign up for office hours some time this week (we'll have extra) so you can finish the board and be able to do next week's lab.

Ask for a demo by an existing member and watch carefully. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions, but remember you'll probably figure out your own favorite way to solder.

### Notes
- You're not coloring. Don't melt a ton of solder onto the iron and then smear it around. It doesn't work like that.
- Flux is your friend.
- Tinning tips is important! If the tip of the soldering iron you're using isn't nice and shiny, solder won't stick to it, and it'll transfer heat worse. Tin the tip by melting a blob of solder onto it and wiping off the access in a copper wool. A thin layer, just enoug to coat the tip, should stay behind. If you're worried, ask for help.
- Soldering takes forever when you start. Don't worry.

## Next Steps
The board that you just soldered is designed to work with a BRAIN and blink some LEDs. We're going to write firmware that can blink the LEDs, just as a little more practice.
