## Introduction
Welcome to CalSol! We're the electrical subteam on Berkeley's Solar Car team, and over the next few weeks you'll learn about what the club and the team does. Hopefully you got the quick intro during the general meeting and electrical meeting, but if not or you ever have any questions ask any returning member in person or on slack. Everyone is welcome join regardless of prior experience, and you're also free to try out other subteams and explore to see what interests you the most.

Over most of the next semester, you'll be doing a series of labs like this one that guide you through the essentials of electrical. Most are designed to be completed in one week, but the time it takes will depend on your skill level. No worries if a lab takes you three weeks or you breeze through four in one week, we'll do our best to accomodate everyone. See the main git repository for a general overview of the weeks.
